All around the world, we could make time
Rompin' and a stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the north and sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine, but I must warn ya
'Bout the motherf-cking girls from California
Alabama baby said hallelujah
Good God girl, I wish I knew ya
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say hello and then I say adieu
Come back baby 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world, back from Bombay
Fox hole love Pie in your face
Living in and out of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride step aside my Johnson
Yes, I could in the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake, it's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say hello and then I say adieu
Where you wanna go, who you wanna be
What you wanna do, just come with me
I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me girl sittin' in the Swiss mountains
Me oh my oh me and guy ho
Freer than a bird 'cause were rockin' Ohio
Around the world I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful
I know, I know for sure
Ding ding, dong dong, ding ding, dong dong, ding ding
I know, I know it's you
Ding ding, dong dong, ding ding, dong dong, ding ding
Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world
And I have seen your love
I know, I know it's you
You say hello and then I say adieu
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first
I'm underwater where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea, just like me
Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything
Staring straight up into the sky, oh, my, my
A solar system that fits in your eye, microcosm
You could die but you're never dead, spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head, fields of space kid
Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything
Psychic changes are born in your heart, entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same, bless your heart, girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on, salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song, I am with you
Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything 
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause
With the birds I'll share
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health, cause
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Blood loss in a bathroom stall
Southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to ma' and pa' cause
With the birds I'll share
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the other side
Well, centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
A stranger thing could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wanna know am I still a slut?
I've got to take it on the other side
A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for the soulmate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever
Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down and then it's born again
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever had
(How long) I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin, or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Destruction leads to a very rough road, but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication

Easily let's get carried away
Easily let's get married today
Shao Lin shouted a rose
From his throat
Everything must go
A lickin' stick is thicker
When you break it to show
Everything must go
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for
Calling, calling for something in the air
Calling, calling, I know you must be there
Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cage
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go
I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over, but it's only on the rise
Calling, calling for something in the air
Calling, calling, I know you must be there
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know I'm coming back
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for
Calling, calling for something in the air
Calling, calling, I know you must be there
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know I'm coming back
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin?
Are you missing the love of your kin?
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain
Do you smell like a girl when you smile?
Can you bear not to share with your child?
Drifting and floating and fading away
Little loon
All day
Little loon
Porcelain
Do you carry the moon in your womb?
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away

The California animal is a bear
Angeleno but the devil may care
Summer time to talk and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I'll take you to the movies there
We could walk through Leicester square
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice was yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primrose hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
It's all right now
Call me now use the satellite
It's all right, it's all right
Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right now
Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right
The California flower is poppy child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
I like dirt

The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream
In your stream

Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one

A letter to the pet better get it to go

Space is made of everything
And I'd be fire that I bring

A letter to the pet better get it to go

Close to my skin I'm falling in
Someone who's been sittin' by the phone
I'm left alone in another zone
John says to live above hell my will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail
My will could sail, yeah!
It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I wanna taste the taste of being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
And I will for you
Sailin' for the sun 'cause there is one who knows where I'm from
I care for you
I really do
I really do
Come closer now
So, you can lie right by my side
Sit alone in the sun
I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself, yeah
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
Close to my skin is someone who's been
I'm a falling in
Disasters are just another star falling in my yard
John says to live above hell my will is well
Long to be with someone to tell
I love your smell
Dusting off your savior
You were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand
To celebrate you is greater
Now that I can, always my man
Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for
Misunderstand, all in a hand
Just like you 'cause you made me
All that I am, all in a hand
A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra
The more I have something to bring
And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light
He's just a man and any damage done
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came
Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior
He's just a man, all in a hand
Your hero's destined to waver
Anyone can, always my man
I would never betray you
Look at me who could raise you
Face in the sand, safe in your hand
You were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand
We are the red hots and
We're loving up the love me nots
The flowers in your flower pots
Are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light
He's just a man and everything he does
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came
Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man
To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin
Python power straight from Monty
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
She's too free and I'm the patient
Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain, I know
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
Up to my ass in alligators
Let's get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did, did what you said
What's the point yo what's the spread
Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain, I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where, I go
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is what I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin
Feather light but you can't move this
Farley is an angel and I can prove this
Purple is a stain upon my pillow
Let's sleep weeping willow
Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain, I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where, I go
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there
But I don't care
'Cause this is what
I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
One shot, all I need I've got rhythm when I bleed
'Til death do us apart
Break my heart so I can start
Supercalifragilistic kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist
It's time to get on top of this
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time, it's right on time (it's right on time)
Lookin' fine, you're lookin' fine and get on nineteen ninety nine (it's right on time)
Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow, bow wow wow
Now I'm here, I'm nowhere now
Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time, it's right on time (it's right on time)
Lookin' fine, you're lookin' fine and get on nineteen ninety nine (it's right on time)
(It's right on time)
Well, plain and simple pain I want to but I can't complain
Death row, let us go it's time to blow up for show
All the world reverberated coming through, we motorcaded
Start off when we operated
Turing up in solid stated
Oh Lord
Road trippin' with my two favorite allies
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
It's time to leave this town, it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost anywhere in the USA
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost
Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
So much as come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf
Staying high and dry's more trouble than it's worth in the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky-dory's got our snakefinger on
Now let us drink the stars, it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost right here in the USA
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost
Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there, waiting for
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload
Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
Get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there, waiting for
Black jack, dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still, I so admired
Bloodshot, your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me she-wolf style
Rip right through me
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run
I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
All the better, to make it is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow, let's go
This is the place where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast but everything gets slow
Can I get some Vaseline, step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid
This is my calling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene, can I kiss your dopamine
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it but I've got to know
This is my calling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
I saw you out there yesterday
What did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray
What did you wanna say?
A masterpiece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
Can I smell your gasoline? Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died I could not get my copper clean
I don't want to take it up with Little Joe
I don't want to fake it but I've gotta know
This is my calling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
I'm a misfit, I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split
I'm in a flash ray a mash of DNA
Another popinjay who thinks he's got something to say
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do?
Take it away, I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay
In you a star is born and
You cut a perfect form and
Someone forever warm
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Way upon the mountain, where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
Show love with no remorse and
Climb onto your seahorse and
This ride is right on course
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way I knew that it would be with you
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Way upon the mountain, where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do
Take it away, I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay
Way upon the mountain, where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm
Make you want to reassume
Now we know it all for sure
I'm a dancehall, dirty break beat
Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
I'm a meth lab, first rehab
Take it all off and step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way
I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
Oh (sideways falling, more will be revealed, my friend)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it (sideways falling)
Come again, get me excited (more will be revealed, my friend)
I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure
I could show you to the free field
Overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
Oh, and (sideways falling, more will be revealed, my friend)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it (sideways falling)
Come again, get me excited (more will be revealed, my friend)
Oh, and (sideways falling, more will be revealed, my friend)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it (sideways falling)
There's a match, now let me light it (more will be revealed, my friend)
I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more, coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure
Make the hair stand up on your arm
Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
I'll be there, tell me when you want to go 
Come again, and tell me when you want to go
More will be revealed my friend
Can I get your hand to write on
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash your light on?
Take a look, it's on display for you
Coming down, no, not today
Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Pick it up, but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on my wind
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look, it's on display for you
Coming down, no, not today
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water, where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We'll find a place together
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, do you
(Yeah) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Whoa) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, want to?
(Yeah) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We're gonna live forever
Forever
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time, I want to be your best friend
East Side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leading me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Wait a minute, I'm passin' out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
How about you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
Right on cue
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time, I want to be your best friend
East Side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
Kick-start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from space to teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through
Something inside the cards I know is right
Don't want to live somebody else's life
This is what I want to be and this is what I give to you
Because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time
I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose
I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
What I really want to do is turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I use my senses, too
You can see that it's only everywhere
I'd take it all in, then I'd find a way to share
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
Come again and tell me where you want to go
What it means to me to be with you alone
Close the door and no one has to know
How we are
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose, make me wanna say
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
Things will never be the same
Still I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one
Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of scorpios a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know
Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Throw away your television
Time to make this clean decision
Master waits for its collision now
It's a repeat
Of a story told
It's a repeat
And it's getting old
Throw away your television
Make a break, big intermission
Re-create your super vision now
It's a repeat
Of a story told
It's a repeat
And it's getting old
Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now
Oy, oy, oy
Throw away your television
Take the noose off your ambition
Re-invent your intuition now
It's a repeat
Of a story told
It's a repeat
And it's getting old
Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now
Throw away your television
Salivate to repetition
Alleviate this ill condition now
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat

I see you in the park
You're always wearing Dodger blue
Mad-doggin me and anyone from any other crew
I am small but I am strong
I'll get it on with you
If you want me to
What else can I do?
Everyone would take a cue from anything you do
If you want them to
What else can they do?
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news
Cabron

I come around and make peace get down have a barbecue
Let keep the moon awake and do electric boogaloo
I am small but I am strong
You see I'm just like you
If you only knew
That I'm just like you
All the world would take a cue from anything you do
If you only knew
That they're just like you
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news
I don't wanna fight

This is my time, this is my tear
I can see clearly now that this is not a place
For playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time, this is my tear
Comin' on strong Baudelaire
Seems to me like all the world gets high
When you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime
All in all and I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and then
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now
Because you never know
Devil may cry, devil may care
Distiller's got a scream and now I know just why
When she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time
California skies got room to spare
This is my time
All in all and I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and then
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now
Because you never know
Oh, never know
Take it outside, take it out there
Seems to me like all the world gets high
When you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time
All in all and I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and then
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now
Because you never know
Oh, never know
I've got myself in a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go?
Shake it off just to redirect my flow
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block
Come again and tell me what you're going through
Like a girl who only knew her child was due
Memories of everything of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through
Looking up into a reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up, another stubborn Scorpio
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block
Come again and tell me what you're going through
Like a girl who only knew her child was due
To the moon, she gave another good review
Turn around and look at me, it's really, really you
Memories of everything, of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block
Memories of everything, of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through
Memories of everything, of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through
I change the key from C to D
You see, to me, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasing
Catfight intimidation
Oh, oh, oh, oh
To read a mind you've got to
Redefine the line to make your circle sing, y'all
He knows everything
You make a sound, the spell is bound
To come around, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasing
Catfight intimidation
All out interfacing
Black star motivation
Vampire, sugar junkie
Databasing infiltration
I change the key from C to D
You see to me it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
Shiver for me, girl
Deliver for me, my darling
Ah, pushing up to you
A river that runs right through you
Swim for your smile in a Blue Rock Quarry
Make it for me, baby, you won't be sorry
Shiver for me now
Deliver for me, my darling
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love, you're never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the water of love
Two of us were made of angel's dust
I've been around, but not around enough
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Quiver for me, girl
Give me your head and shoulders
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love, I'm never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the water of love
Two of us were made of angel's dust
I've been around, but not around enough
Let's go
I know I make it for two, and then
Intuition's only what you take from it
I know I make it for two, and then
You were there and I was fortunate
I know I make it for two, and then
Messy bed a part of cheating I won't fall for you
I know I make it for two, I make it for two, I make it for two and
Shiver for me now
Deliver for me, my darling
A living that I could
Be giving to you, my sweet love
Swim for your smile in a Blue Rock Quarry
Make it for me, baby, you won't be sorry
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your dreams
Settle for love
Settle for love
Settle for love
Does it go from east to west, y'all
Body free and a body less, y'all
Come again just to start afresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in coming through the mesh, y'all
Checking in just to get it blessed, y'all
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam
Where you come from, where you going?
Where you come from, where you going?
Do it all then it all again, y'all
Make it up and you make a friend, y'all
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend, y'all
Hard as hell just to comprehend, y'all
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze
Where you come from, where you going?
Where you come from, where you going?
We all want to tell her, tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her, tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever
I know you said you don't believe
In God, do you still disagree
Now that it's time for you to leave
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of what I know
Where would I be without you, Glo?
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
Your kiss goodbye before you leave
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
